# Object Relational Management

This is a functional Express.js API that uses MySQL and Sequelize to perform CRUD commands, using an application such as Insomnia or Postman.

## Installation
This requires Node.js to install and use. The package.json is already provided, so navigate to the project folder and run npm install. Don't forget to setup the MySQL server using the schema provided, as well as running `node seed/index.js` to add data to the database.

## Usage
Once you've installed the node modules needed, just run `node server.js` to activate the server. Use your preferred API client to perform API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes on the Categories, Tags, and Products.
